 signal generator based on SI5351
</h2>
The device is based on an STM32 MCU, a SI5351 signal generator, a 0.91-inch display controlled by an EC-11 encoder. It is possible to configure each channel separately and save the settings. In addition, you can set a correction value to compensate for differences between the actual frequency and the displayed frequency, and specify a phase shift between the channel signals.
